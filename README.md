# Billboard 100 Playlist Generator 

This Python project scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 songs for a given date and automatically creates a private Spotify playlist with those songs.  

It combines **web scraping** (Billboard website) and the **Spotify Web API** via the `spotipy` library.

 # Spotify Developer Setup

- Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard

- Create an app to obtain your client_id and client_secret.

- Add a Redirect URI (e.g., https://example.com/) in the app settings.

- Replace the placeholders in the code with your credentials:

   ```bash
  client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
   client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  
# Authentication (Token)

Before running the script, you must manually authenticate with Spotify and obtain an OAuth token:

- Use your app credentials (`client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri`) to request authorization from Spotify.
- You can do this with the Spotipy documentation
 or directly via the OAuth flow.

- After granting access, Spotify will return a token.

- Save this token in a file called `token.txt` in the project directory.

- The script will read this file to authenticate.

- If the token expires, youâ€™ll need to refresh it or generate a new one.
